# case-2-team-3

## Background
This project uses consumer data belonging to a Hackathon organized by "Univ.AI". All values were provided at the time of the loan application. It contains 12 columns, including income, age, experience, profession, marriage, house ownership, car ownership, risk flag, job years, house tears, city and state.
We would like to predict the probability and possible defaulters for the consumer loans product. They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is riskier and who is not.
We hope our model could be very useful for not only the banking industry but also the whole society, including the government, the insurance institutes, etc.
